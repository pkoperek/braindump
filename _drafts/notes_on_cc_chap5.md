title: notes on Clean Code - Formatting chapter
---

  * **Formatting is important**
  * A source code file should read like a newspaper article. 
    * Name should be simple and explanatory.
    * Top parts of the file should provide high-level concepts.
    * The lower == the more detailed information.
  * Blank lines can identify separate concepts.
  * **Pieces of code which are related should be kept close in source code.**
  * Instance variables should live at the top of the class file.
  * Local variable should be declared as close to the place of usage as possible.
  * This which are conceptually similar should be close to each other. 
  * Code which is executed from a function, should be below that function.
  * Lines should be at most 120 columns wide. (*Uncle's Bob personal preference*)
  * Preserve indentation of blocks.

**Set team formatting rules and make everyone use them!**
