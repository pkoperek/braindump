Based on the title I was expecting that video to be yet another talk about how modern software companies are disrupting all kinds of business. Couldn't be more wrong :) Erik demolished totally commonly used agile rules and techniques. I wouldn't agree with all what he said there ... but he made his point: I started to think about them with more criticism. For me this is the whole point: stop merely _following_ the process. Think of your own and work the way which make you the most effective. 

Would forget: video from talk is [here][1].
