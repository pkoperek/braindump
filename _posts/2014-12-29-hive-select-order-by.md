Just came into an interesting bug: (HIVE-2954)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2954] and (HIVE-4564)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4564].
The best part:

```
Resolution: Unresolved
Affects Version/s: 0.9.0
Fix Version/s: 0.9.1
```

Resolved or not resolved? :) 
My version of hive (0.10) still has it - so probably everything later has it as well.
