Notes and observations from watching a lecture by Tyler Bosmeny - Clever CEO.

* Sales is not what you see in movies (men in expensive suits etc).
* Sales is about talking to users.
* Being passionate and knowledgeable about the problem you are solving is
  extremely helpful while selling.
* Sales is about creating a funnel. Stages:
  * Prospecting - finding who might be interested in the product
  * Conversations - you reach to people and check whether they are actually
    interested, if the product is a good match
  * Closing - get the committment
  * Revenue :)

## Prospecting

* figure out who will take the call
* "you will hear a lot of 'nos'"
* innovators (people who might be willing to pay for your service) are just
  2,5% of the population
* you need to talk to _a lot_ of people
* best methods
  * reach out to your network
  * conferences
    * small gatherings of people who are potential users
    * figure out top conferences for your field
    * ask organizers for a list of people who are attending (_GDPR????_)
    * email them and explain what are you working on and that you would like to
      spend some time to have a chat (30mins?) and show them what you have and
      maybe they would be interested in this.
    * go to the conference, hopefully with 30min slots booked from morning till
      late evening
    * talk and sell :)
  * cold emails (_GDPR????_)
    * very effective if done well
    * short, to the point, personalized, tells why people should care
    * goal - get to stage 2 - a conversation

## Conversations

> Sales is about listening.

* Shut up and listen.
* Best sales people in the world listen a lot and ask questions
  * "Why did you even agree to have a call with me?"
  * "What is the problem you hoped to solve?"
  * "What would be the ideal solution if you could have anything?"

## Closing

* don't fuss on the contract details
* YC has a free contract template
* for the first/two customers do whatever it takes, but in general do not do
  1-off "please add this one feature" implementations
  * say instead: "sorry, but we can't accomodate individual user requests, if
    we get feedback from more users this is missing, we will add this"
* instead of 60-day free trial, do 1-year contract with 30-day cancellation
  * this is meeting customer in the middle: you let them cancel if they don't
    like it, but by default they are your customers
