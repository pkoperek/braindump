title: notes on Clean Code - Meaningful Names chapter
---

Names are the essence of source code - hence need to choose them with great care.

  * Create names which show the intention, how the named thing should be used.
  * Avoid confusioni: don't use names using many similar words with tiny differences.
  * Names should be easy to pronounce.
  * Don't make them clever/cute/funny - it is easy to forget what they actually mean.
  * Use a single name per concept and make it consistent across the code base.
  * Use the language of domain in which the project is in.
  * Add meaningful context.
