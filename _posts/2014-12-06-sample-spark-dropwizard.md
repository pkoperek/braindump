Recently I was playing a bit with [dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
Both projects are extremely interesting - although are completely different and come from separate domains. 
I hope that someone will find those simple projects helpful:

  * [Sample dropwizard project](https://github.com/pkoperek/sample-dropwizard)
  * [Sample Apache Spark project](https://github.com/pkoperek/sample-spark)
